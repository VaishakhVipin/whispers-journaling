🗣️ Whispers
Talk. Recall. Repeat.
A blazing-fast voice journal that remembers everything you say — searchable with AI.

✨ What is Whispers?
Whispers is a voice-first journaling app powered by:

🧠 <300ms Latency Streaming Transcription (AssemblyAI)

💬 Claude/Gemini (Free Plan) for semantic summaries & tagging

🔍 Algolia MCP for instant search of your thoughts

You talk. It listens, transcribes, understands, and makes it all searchable later.

🧪 Why It Matters
Most thoughts disappear as fast as they're spoken. Whispers is a second brain you can speak into — and search like Google.

This isn't a note-taking app.
It's a verbal memory system.

Use-cases:

Founders brain-dumping startup ideas

Students journaling reflections

Creators capturing sparks of content

Anyone needing private, searchable voice logs
